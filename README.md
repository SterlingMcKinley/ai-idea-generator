# AI IDEA GENERATOR

As I dive into the Generative AI space I came up with this project idea to utilize AI to assist in creating other AI projects, initiatives, or efforts.

This AI project creates a web application where users can input a broad topic, and an AI (powered by OpenAI's GPT model) will generate a list of creative and unique ideas related to that topic.

In this project will incorporate AI, Python, and web interfaces.

The Tools I used:

- Python: The core programming language.
- Streamlit: [Python Library] For building a simple, interactive web user interface without needing complex web development knowledge.
- OpenAI API: To leverage the power of a large language model (LLM) like GPT for idea generation.
